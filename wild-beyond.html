  <h3 id="what-is-it">What is it</h3>

<p>Wild Beyond is a free-to-play real time strategy (RTS) game with the visual quality and strategic gameplay depth of a console game in a mobile-first package.</p>

<p>Pocket Gems aimed to create their next successful franchise by satisfying the wants of Console &amp; PC Gamers 17-35 looking for deep gameplay on the go.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Featured “Game of the Day” on Apple App Store (11/24/2018)</p>

<h3 id="why-i-joined">Why I joined</h3>

<p>Wild Beyond represented a <strong>new direction</strong> for Pocket Gems, and I was excited to work on a game that I was wanted to play myself.</p>

<p>It was also a huge opportunity for <strong>personal growth</strong>, to be on the ground floor and contribute to a product development cycle from concept to launch.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>As UX lead, I grew and managed the UX team responsible for the game’s user experience over a 4 year development cycle and worldwide launch.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="major-challenges">Major Challenges</h3>

<ul>
  <li>As a team we struggled between prioritizing between 2 audiences; balancing depth and strategy for core gamers versus learnability and usability with mainstream mobile audience</li>
  <li>A Major competitor launched when we were mid-development which disrupted our product strategy and led to a major internal game design pivot.</li>
  <li>We worked with a new in-house 3D engine that was being developed in tandem with our game. Game rendering required learning and managing multiple tech stacks (iOS native, Cocos2D, Cocos3D, HTML/CSS/Angular).</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="what-i-accomplished">What I accomplished</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Grew the design team as project scaled; including hiring, onboarding, and training
Implemented and managed the pipeline for multiple designers across pods through a successful worldwide launch.</li>
  <li>Designed several features that produced measurable increase in early retention and conversion</li>
  <li>Collaborated with engineering to define and create a component based UI framework which reduced UI implementation time by ~30% and improved overall quality and consistency.</li>
  <li>Implemented and managed the pipeline for multiple designers across pods.</li>
  <li>Established internal UX processes; contributions include process and pipeline creation for visual design, design, and development</li>
  <li>Co-authored the company’s UX career track, established the company’s first cross-studio design meetings, and cultivated team culture through collaborative training, presentations, and team events.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h3>
<p><strong>Consistent Quality</strong> <br />
<strong>Commit fully to redesigns</strong> <br />
<strong>Letting go</strong> <br /></p>
